# Warm Up

# Take the next 2-3 minutes to look at the example below.
# In your notebook or in this file, write down your answers to the following
# questions.

# 1. What is the 'Collection'?
# A hash or an array
# 2. What do you notice about the code below?
# We have an array with 3 names in it and we are using puts 3 times to print all names
# 3. What issues could potentially crop up?
# If we have an array that's big, we will need to make our code really long to output each name. We also might not know how many elements are in the array.
# 4. Is there an alternative you could propose?
# Using the each method to go through each element of the array and shorten the code.

students = ["Megan", "Bob", "Mike"]
# puts students[0]
# puts students[1]
# puts students[2]

# Go ahead and play in your terminal to see what the outputs are.
# After you take a guess, uncomment each `puts` one at a time.
# See if you were correct.
